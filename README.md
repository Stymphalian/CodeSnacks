A repository holding my common configuration files as well as any code snippets
that I find very useful.
Currently this only has JS snippets.

List of things I need to organize:
  C++ Snippets ( priority_queue constructor)
  Python common snippets
  Config settings for IDE (Visual Studio,Eclipse)
  bash.rc
